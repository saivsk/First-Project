ps role in DevOps compared to traditional IT operations
To better understand how DevOps changes the responsibilities of operations teams, it will help to recap the traditional, pre-DevOps role of operations. Let’s take a look at a typical organization’s software lifecycle: before DevOps, developers package an application with documentation, and then ship it to a QA team. The QA teams install and test the application, and then hand off to production operations teams. The operations teams are then responsible for deploying and managing the software with little-to-no direct interaction with the development teams.

These dev-to-ops handoffs are typically one-way, often limited to a few scheduled times in an application’s release cycle. Once in production, the operations team is then responsible for managing the service’s stability and uptime, as well as the infrastructure that hosts the code. If there are bugs in the code, the virtual assembly line of dev-to-qa-to-prod is revisited with a patch, with each team waiting on the other for next steps. This model typically requires pre-existing infrastructure that needs to be maintained, and comes with significant overhead. While many businesses continue to remain competitive with this model, the faster, more collaborative way of bridging the gap between development and operations is finding wide adoption in the form of DevOps.
